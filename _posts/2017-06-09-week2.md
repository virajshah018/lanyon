## Learning ReLUs via gradient descent
In our 3<sup>rd</sup> meet this Tuesday, **Gauri** volunteered to present the paper titled [Learning ReLUs via gradient descent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.04591.pdf) -- theoretical results proving linear convergence of projected gradient descent algorithm, to fit Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) to data, using optimal number of samples.

In next meet on Friday, **Gauri** will present [Towards understanding invertibility of CNNs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08664.pdf).

**Notes** will be uploaded once available.
