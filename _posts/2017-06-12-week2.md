## Learning ReLUs via gradient descent

In our 3<sup>rd</sup> meet last Tuesday, **Gauri** volunteered to present the paper titled [Learning ReLUs via gradient descent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.04591.pdf) -- theoretical results proving linear convergence of projected gradient descent algorithm, to fit Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) to data, using optimal number of samples.

**Notes** for Tuesday meeting are [here](https://goo.gl/z7pJ56).

In next meet on Friday, **Gauri** concluded the topic of Tuesday's meet.

**Notes** for Friday meeting will be uploaded once available.
