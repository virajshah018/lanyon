## Towards understanding invertibility of CNNs
In next meet this Friday, **Gauri** will conclude the topic of last meet and will present [Towards understanding invertibility of CNNs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08664.pdf).

**Notes** for Friday meeting will be uploaded once available.

In our 3<sup>rd</sup> meet last Tuesday, **Gauri** volunteered to present the paper titled [Learning ReLUs via gradient descent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.04591.pdf) -- theoretical results proving linear convergence of projected gradient descent algorithm, to fit Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) to data, using optimal number of samples.
