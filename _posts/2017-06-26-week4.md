## Generative Adversarial Networks and Wasserstein GANs

In our 6<sup>th</sup> meet this Tuesday, **Viraj** will complete the last piece of [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf) paper in the first half.

In the second half of the meet, Dr. Chinmay will present the [Wasserstein GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07875.pdf) paper. The idea behind this presentation is to understand the motivation and developing the background behind the notion of Wasserstein distance in context of GAN.


**Notes** for the meeting and other additional resources will be posted here once available.
