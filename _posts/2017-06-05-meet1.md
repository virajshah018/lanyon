## On the Computational Efficiency of Training Neural Networks
In last meet,  **Mohammadreza Soltani** volunteered to present the paper titled [On the Computational Efficiency of Training Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.1141.pdf), while following paper also was discussed in support.

* [Convex Factorization Machines](http://mblondel.org/publications/mblondel-ecmlpkdd2015.pdf)

In upcoming Friday's meet, we will continue from where we left last time, towards following papers : 

* [Lifted coordinate descent for learning with trace-norm regularization](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00756802/document)
* [Polynomial Networks and Factorization Machines: New Insights and Efficient Training Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.08810.pdf)

Notes to both meetings will be updated here once available.
